# Flight Reservation System (C)

## Project Description

The **Flight Reservation System** is a console-based application written in **C** that simulates a basic airline ticket booking system.  
It allows users to book flight seats, select routes and departure times, choose a payment method, and store reservation details using file handling.

This project is designed primarily for **students and beginners in C programming** who want to learn how to build a real-world application using structures, functions, file I/O, and basic user interaction.

## Features

- Book flight tickets through a text-based menu  
- Select departure and destination cities  
- Choose flight time schedules  
- Automatic seat number allocation using randomization  
- Payment method selection (Debit or Credit)  
- Store passenger details (name, email, seat number, route, payment type)  
- Cancel previously booked tickets  
- Persistent storage using file handling (`fwrite`, `fread`)  

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Standard Libraries:**
  - `stdio.h` – input/output operations  
  - `string.h` – string manipulation  
  - `time.h` – random seat generation  
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Structures (`struct`)  
  - Functions  
  - File handling  
  - Conditional statements and loops  
  - Console-based user interface  

## Installation

1. Ensure a C compiler (such as **GCC**) is installed on your system.  
2. Clone the repository or download the source file.  
3. Compile the program:


## Usage

Run the compiled executable:

Follow the on-screen menu to:
- Book a flight ticket  
- Enter passenger information  
- Select payment method  
- Cancel an existing reservation  

All booking information is stored locally in a file created by the program.

## Project Structure


## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication (login system)  
- Improve input validation and error handling  
- Display all booked tickets  
- Add admin features for managing flights  
- Refactor into a modular, multi-file structure  
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
